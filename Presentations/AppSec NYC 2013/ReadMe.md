# Security-Principles Presentation

This presentation was given at AppSec USA 2013 in New York City. 
This is the entire source of the presentation in LaTeX.

I feel strongly that the community should not use propritary formats for data files, as this precludes people from participation who are for one reason or another unable to legally afford or aquire the proprietary software needed to use the data.
Therefore, I have put this together as a learning example for others so that they may also participate using only open source tools and formats.

## Use of Images
Unfortunately, most images are googled, and are used without atribution or permision. 
I try and use only open licenses for images. I use TinEye to locate the images, but often can not find any attributions or licensing information at all.
If you are the author or owner of such an image and would like attribution I would like to attribute you for your work. 
Additionally, if you would like your image removed, I would be happy to do this also.

## OWASP Branding
The colors and logo used are from the official OWASP branding materials found in the [OWASP Logo Toolbox.](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/07/OWASP_Image_Toolbox.zip)
