%% Presentation Themes 
%%

% Conceptually, a presentation theme dictates for every single detail of a 
% presentation what it looks like. Thus, choosing a particular presentation 
% theme will setup for, say, the numbers in enumeration what color they have, 
% what color their background has, what font is used to render them, whether a 
% circle or ball or rectangle or whatever is drawn behind them, and so forth. 
% Thus, when you  choose a presentation theme, your presentation will look the 
% way someone (the creator of the theme) thought that a presentation should look 
% like. Presentation themes typically only choose a particular color theme, font 
% theme, inner theme, and outer theme that go well together.

%% Color Themes 
%%

% A color theme only dictates which colors are used in a presentation. If you 
% have chosen a particular presentation theme and then choose a color theme, 
% only the colors of your presentation will change. A colour theme can specify 
% colors in a very detailed way: For example, a colour theme can specifically 
% change the colors used to render, say, the border of a button, the background 
% of a button, and the text on a button.

%% Font Themes 
%%

%A font theme dictates which fonts or font attributes are used in a 
% presentation. As for colors, the font of all text elements used in a 
% presentation can be specified independently.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% Inner Themes 
%%

% An inner theme specifies how certain elements of a presentation are typeset. 
% This includes all elements that are at the “inside” of the frame, that is, 
% that are not part of the headline, footline, or sidebars. This includes all
% enumerations, itemize environments, block environments, theorem environments,
% or the table of contents. For example, an inner theme might specify that in 
% an enumeration the number should be typeset without a dot and that a small 
% circle should be shown behind it. The inner theme would not specify what 
% color should be used for the number or the circle (this is the job of the 
% color theme) nor which font should be used (this is the job of the font 
% theme).

%% Title and part pages.
%% Itemize environments.
%% Enumerate environments.
%% Description environments.
%% Block environments.
%% Theorem and proof environments.
%% Figures and tables.
%% Footnotes.
%% Bibliography entries.

%%% Outer Themes
%%%

% An outer theme specifies what the “outside” or “border” of the presentation 
% slides should look like. It specifies whether there are head- and footlines, 
% what is shown in them, whether there is a sidebar, where the logo goes, where 
% the navigation symbols and bars go, and so on. It also specifies where the 
% frametitle is put and how it is typeset.


%% The head and footline -----------------------------------------------------------


%% The sidebars --------------------------------------------------------------------


%% The logo ------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Now the logo. As it turns out. I could not include the logo in the headline. If I 
% tried to, the headline kept shifting downwards. Acting a little smart and lazy, I 
% just included the logo in the right sidebar and shifted it up. 

\addtobeamertemplate{frametitle}{}{%
\begin{textblock*}{75mm}(0.98\textwidth, -1cm)
\includegraphics[height=0.85cm,width=0.85cm]{images/owasp_logo_white}
\end{textblock*}} % Include OWASP logo in title at top right
